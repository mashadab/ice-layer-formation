This dataset contains the forcing provided to all models for the firn meltwater Retention Intercomparison Project (RetMIP):

Vandecrux, B., Mottram, R., Langen, P. L., Fausto, R. S., Olesen, M., Stevens, C. M., Verjans, V., Leeson, A., Ligtenberg, S., Kuipers Munneke, P., Marchenko, S., van Pelt, W., Meyer, C., Simonsen, S. B., Heilig, A., Samimi, S., Marshall, S., Machguth, H., MacFerrin, M., Niwano, M., Miller, O., Voss, C. I., and Box, J. E.: The firn meltwater Retention Model Intercomparison Project (RetMIP): Evaluation of nine firn models at four weather station sites on the Greenland ice sheet, The Cryosphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-331, 2020.

The forcing files consist of 1) three-hourly time series of snow surface temperature, net accumulation (positive for snowfall and vapor deposition and negative for sublimation) and melt and 2) initial profiles for firn density, temperature and liquid water content. These fields are available at four sites located in different climate zones of the Greenland ice sheet: Summit, Dye-2, KAN_U and the firn aquifer site (FA). At the Dye-2 sites, two forcing data files are available: one covering 1998-2015 and another one derived from more recent instruments over the 2016 melt season. 

At Summit and Dye-2 (for 1998-2015), we use data from the GC-Net (http://cires1.colorado.edu/steffen/gcnet/) automatic weather stations (AWS), at Dye-2 for 2016 we use the AWS from  Samimi et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL089211), at KAN_U data from the PROMICE AWS (https://www.promice.dk), and at FA data from the AWS maintained by IMAU at Utrecht University (https://www.projects.science.uu.nl/iceclimate/aws/).

Surface temperature and vapour fluxes were calculated at hourly resolution using the surface energy budget closure from van As (2005, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-004-4631-1), as implemented in Vandecrux et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004597). The energy budget used measurements of air temperature, humidity, pressure and net shortwave radiation. Downward longwave radiations was measured at Dye-2 (for 2016), KAN_U and FA but were extracted from the closest cell in HIRHAM regional climate model at Dye-2 (1998-2015) and Summit. Sensible and latent heat fluxes were calculated using the bulk approach. Surface temperature (and consequently upward longwave radiation) was solved iteratively at each time step to close the energy budget.

Snowfall was derived from surface height observations available at each station, first with an a-priori surface snow density of 315 kg m-3 (Fausto et al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2018.00051), then adjusted to multiple snowpit observations available at each site.

Gap-free meteorological fields were obtained using the approach from Vandecrux et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004597) which adjusts the output from HIRHAM climate model to match at best the observations and use these adjusted values to fill the gaps in the instrumental records. 

For each site, we use measured upward and downward shortwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and instrument height after filtering erroneous measurements. If two measurement levels are available on the weather station, we use primarily the upper level, less prone to burial under new snow, and use the lower level when the upper one is not available. Measurements lower than 0.5 m above the surface were discarded. Gaps smaller than 6h were interpolated linearly. Remaining larger gaps were filled using secondary data sources: either nearby station (see details in https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004597Vandecrux et al. (2018)) or closest cell in the regional climate model HIRHAM5 output (Lucas-Picher et al., 2011, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016267; Langen et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00271.1; Langen et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2016.00110). A scaling was applied to the secondary data source to match at best the available measurements at each station before it is used for gap-filling. Gaps in upward shortwave radiation were filled using downward shortwave radiation and surface albedo observed by MODIS satellites. Downward longwave radiation was not monitored by the weather station. We therefore use longwave radiation from the closest cell in HIRHAM5 output. Precipitation was calculated from surface height observations by the weather station. More details are available in Vandecrux et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004597).

Time series were eventually summed or averaged over three-hourly time steps.
