- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) >= 1.16
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) >=1.5
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) >=3.3.4


### Quick Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the required libraries, run the Python files corresponding to the figure numbers as given in the paper. Codes can be run either directly or on an IDE such as Anaconda Spyder. `Solver` is the folder containing the auxiliaries.
Comments are provided in the code.
